This is a minimalist React application that fetches data from a specified Reddit subreddit and displays a list of posts. The application caches the JSON response in the browser's `localStorage` to reduce redundant API requests and improve performance when the same subreddit is visited again.

## Features
- Fetches a list of posts from a specified subreddit.
- Caches the JSON response in `localStorage` to improve loading time for repeated visits.
- Displays basic post information, reducing load time
